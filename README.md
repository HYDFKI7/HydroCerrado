# HydroCerrado
[..under construction..]

The HydroCerrado is a regional-sample data set for catchments within the Cerrado biome.
The data set was compiled by Althoff et al. (2021, unpublished) and includes data from gauge stations, respective catchment boundaries, daily streamflow series, daily time series of meteorological forcing (precipitation and reference evapotranspiration), and catchment attributes.

The time series in the data set cover the period from 2000-06-01 to 2014-12-31 for catchments with > 5 years equivalent of observed data.
Precipitation and reference evapotranspiration daily time series are catchment averages from the Integrated Multi-SatellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) (Huffman et al., 2019b, 2019a) and from the gridded reference evapotranspiration for Brazil based on machine learning (ETo-Brazil) (Althoff et al., 2020a, 2020b) 

The catchment attributes are related to:
- Topography (area, mean elevation, and mean slope);
- Climate indices (mean annual precipitation, mean annual evapotranspiration, timing of precipitation index, and aridity index);
- Soil characteristics (clay content, silt content, sand content, organic carbon content, and bulk density); and
- Land cover characteristics (forest formation, forest plantation, savanna formation, grassland, pasture, crops, urban infrastructure, river and lake, and wetland fractions). 

Topography indices are derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model at 3 arc-seconds (Earth Resources Observation And Science Center, 2017); the climate indices derived from the precipitation and reference evapotranspiration time series; soil characteristics derived from the SoilGrids (Hengl et al., 2017) for the top 2.0 m soil layer; and the land cover characteristics derived from the MapBiomas (MapBiomas, 2020).
